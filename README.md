# Mysli

Mysli (=My Shopping List) is a free and open source shopping list app. I didn't find a good one which met all my requirements so I made this.

## Ideas (a.k.a. todo)

- General
  - Use generated routes
- List view
  - Show nice icon when empty
  - Grouped list package?
  - Swipe gestures
    - <-- Decrease/delete
    - --> Increase
  - Remember & suggest old items
    - Press & hold suggestion to delete it
  - Categories
  - Click to check
    - Move to bottom of list
  - Add +1 amount if item is already in the list
- Settings
  - Sort categories
- Extra stuff
  - Save presets for foods
- Release
  - Add vibration to android manifest

## Stuff I've learned

- BLoC

## Notes for myself

- Swipeable ListTiles aren't as satisfying as I thought they would be. Might change it to something different.
